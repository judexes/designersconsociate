                    <p class="font2 lead">2020</p>
                    <p>We had the opportunity to nominate two African craft brands for Create Day 2020, a new global initiative from London Craft Week, celebrating the creative process of craftsmanship, the talented makers and their work. </p>
                    <p>We nominated:</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold m-0">Studio Lani</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold m-0">AAKS</p>
                    <p>AAKS introduces the world to the weaving techniques of the women of Ghana, while creating sustainable jobs in Africa.
